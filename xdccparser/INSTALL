Requirements:
PHP5 (has not been tested with PHP4, but it should work)
Smarty Template Engine
Highly Recommended:
XCache (will work without it, but will be noticeably slower if there are many packs.) 

See your host for questions regarding the requirements.


Instructions: 

all packlists must be in the packlists folder.
you can either use a cron to upload, or use your own solution built into iroffer. whatever works for you.
make sure templates_c and cache is chmoded to 777

IMPORTANT:
Please note that the packlists are cached and will not automagically update whenever the packlist is replaced.
An example packlist updater is included as packup.php
